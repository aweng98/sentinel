# TODO(marco): this is currently picked up in the classpath, it should instead be configured via
#   the -Dconfiguration.file property, when launching the server.

# The bootstrap file
application.bootstrap.file = "/etc/sentinel/bootstrap.json"

# This controls whether each API Request is authenticated via the supplied API Key:
application.signature.validate = true

# Database configuration, requires a URI of the form `mongodb://host[:port]/dbname`
#
# This example URI is nonsense by design, as having it point to a (sometimes) correct database
# has masked errors in the code logic.
# To run tests use: `sbt test -Dsentinel.test.db_uri="mongodb://dockerdev/sentinel-test"`
# pointing it to a test database (ideally, running in a Docker container).
#
# In production, either generate the correct value in this file, or use the
# `override.conf` mechanism (see further below).
db_uri = "mongodb://localhost/sentinel"

# Global object class
# application.global=Global

# Root logger:
logger.root = ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play = WARN

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application = INFO

# Custom override configuration - this is NOT checked under source control, developers can create
# their own override and place it alongside this file and it will be picked up.
# Unfortunately, Play does not allow constructs of the kind ${HOME}/.sentinel/override.conf that
# would have made this so much more useful.
